		<p><a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> is my favorite app ever because of its beautiful design layout, illustrations, and even what the app is meant for: meditation. The design layout of Headspace is very simple and straightforward but very pleasing. Each meditation course is represented by flat, two-dimensional characters and designs that are also later animated into short videos explaining what to do in that class. Under each course, there is a bar that shows how much progress you have completed. In addition, for nighttime meditation options like help with going to sleep, the app has a different section where all the colors go from warm and orange to cool and blue to represent the night. So, since the background color changes, the rest of the elements and typography also changes but proportionally, so it does not feel like a different application.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> is a language learning app that I've had since December 2015. I downloaded it on my phone as part of my new year's resolution to learn the Portuguese language. This means that during these past five years, I have seen how much the app has changed and I have been able to try out many different languages as well. Over the years, Duolingo has been trying to become more user friendly, especially by simplifying even their logo and unique bird character to a few simple shapes. Duolingo has also integrated a new night mode feature where the entire app is on a dark screen instead of a white one.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> is one of the applications that I use the most because I use it for four different accounts. With that said, one of the most helpful things that Instagram has enabled, is being able to switch between different accounts within a single tap. Once your accounts have been logged into, they will be kept in memory and switching accounts would be extremely easy and quick. In addition, Instagram has also added a night mode feature where the entire app is on a dark screen which is easier on the eyes. </p>

<p>Category: Photo Editing</p>
		<p>Rating: &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734; 4.0</p>
		<p><a href="https://vsco.co/">VSCO</a> is an application for editing photos, but it also serves as a little platform for posting them and sharing your photos with other friends that also have the application. The greatest thing about this app is its ability to store images forever. Whatever is posted on its platform, is basically at your disposal for as long as you want. There have been many images that I have taken, edited, and posted, and then used years later once I remembered them for any later project. It is also very user friendly when editing because you can tap on any editing tool and undo its actions if you change your mind. </p>
